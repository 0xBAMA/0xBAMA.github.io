<h2>Raytracing in One Weekend</h2>

<br>
<p>
&nbsp Writeup WIP
</p>
<br>

<p>
&nbsp I got involved in a group the past few weeks that is essentially an online book club for graphics books and papers, organized by some people at UC Boulder. The first few meetings have been focused on implementing Raytracing in One Weekend - I made a few changes to the code supplied by the book, but a lot of the code is very similar to their implementation. I'm going to work through the rest of the series, and then I plan on implementing a GPU-based version. Some important things to focus on are the acceleration structures, and I will need to think about how to pass this into a compute shader using SSBOs.
